# DEMO README

This demo is using scene collections to load scenes. For this to work the scenes needs to be added to build settings.
Each Scene Collection detects if the scenes contained within has been added to the build settings. Click the red X to add it to the build settings, or do it manually.

**For project collections one can use the shortcut under Tools/Multi Scene Tools/Add All Scenes In Collections to Build, this will not work on the demo scenes as they are not in the selected asset folder.**

Now open any of the desired scene collections within the demo folder, or open the DemoAwake scene by itself.
